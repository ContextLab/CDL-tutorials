Sphinx is a tool to create easy and maintainable documentation.  In the lab, we use it to create websites (e.g. hypertools.readthedocs.io) that host documentation, examples and tutorials for our software. To get started, install the required packages:

# Install required packages
2. Inside `CDL-tutorials/packages/docs` run `pip install -r doc_requirements.txt`
This will install all the libraries you need to generate our documentation.
