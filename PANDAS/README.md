# PANDAS

Pandas is based on both nump.py and python so experience in those fields would be helpful with this package and the tutorial. However, the tutorial is designed so that no experience with either is needed and both nump.py and python are imported for you when needed. 


**What is PANDAS and this tutorial?** 

PANDAS is a tool for data analysis in python this repository is based on a Udemy tutorial linked here (https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-in-python-with-pandas/learn/v4/t/lecture/2339796?start=150).  

**Where to start**

Inside the Notebooks folder you will find a "cheat sheet" and an "organization and logic" notebook. In these you will find the most common commands in the package and some insights as to why the package is structured the way it is. 

After checking out both of these notebooks try to tackle some of the tutorials (recommended to do in order) which give challenges on how to use the most common pandas commands as well as the pandas tools the lab will be using most often. If you get stuck on a tutorial there are walkthroughs of each one and many of the commands needed are in the “cheat sheet” notebook.

If you are looking to solve a particular problem perhaps the "rolling apply", "PANDAS Math", or "NaNs Problem" might be the right place for you to start.
