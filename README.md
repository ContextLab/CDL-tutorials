# Tutorials

This is a repo containing useful tutorials on different packages the lab commonly uses. Currently we have a tutorial for PANDAS and are in the process of creating other tutorials for tools like TravisCI, Docker, TensorFlow and more!

Through this link () you can find the docker image and instructions on how to set up and install it. The benefit of doing so is that the image contains the same versions of the packages used by the lab when creating the tutorials.

While you can approach these tutorials in any order you want it The Contextual Dynamics Lab recommends first the Docker tutorial, then following this suggested sequence (create when all/more tutorials are done). Or one could also organize their learning by theme (Code management, Data wrangling, Experiment design, Debugging and testing, Documentation/Communication, etc.) (flag themes on GitHub similar to flagging issues?)

If you need help or if something is unclear join our slack's computrons channel here (https://context-lab.slack.com/messages/C63L5EBKK/).

## Care to contribute? Please do! ##
Many of the packages we are making tutorials of are only possible due to open science and communication between programmers and aspirating developers. We hope that by creating these tutorials we make others more comfortable with these topics as well! If you noticed that you learn a different way than us or have an excellent example to share, please share it! 

We ask that you fork first, make your changes and then submit a pull request. Instructions on how to do that here (https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). We really appreciate the time you take doing this to make these tutorials better for others.
