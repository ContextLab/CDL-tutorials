This template folder is designed to be a guide for making the tutorials in this repository. The Contextual Dynamics Lab does ask that the guidelines outlined below appear in the tutorials added to this repo and other pages/files/tools are always welcome as well.

A complete tutorial:
  - contains a README with:
      - what the tutorial is for, potential use cases, and how the tutorial is organized
      - a list of the notebooks and datasets included in the tutorial with clickable links
      - describes how to install the necessary dependencies for running the tutorials
  - is self-contained:
      - meaning that the module itself is sharable and doesn't reference other modules in the repo
      - with the exception of referencing to other tutorials as potential prerequisites or next steps in a learning guide (i.e. "to do the Pandas tutorial, you should first do the Python tutorial" (with a clickable link to the python tutorial))
          - please link these in the README or as you are referencing them
