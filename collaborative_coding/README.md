# Collaborative Coding

This tutorial introduces two collaborative coding methods, Google Colaboratory and Atom's Teletype, with a tutorial for the latter. Collaborative coding is great for a project where multiple people are working on the same code. 

The Python package matplotlib is required to run this tutorial. To install the requirements for this package use pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need to install Atom, and install the Teletype package by going to Settings (?,) , and click the button + Install to search for this package. To run the code, you will also need the atom-runner package.
