This directory contains a PDF of handwritten notes explaining two ways to think of correlation values: using Pearson R equation and using cosine similarity of mean-centered vectors. It is intended to introduce and encourage geometric and linear-algebra-style thinking about data analyses commonly performed by psychologists and neuroscientists.

A video will be added shortly with a verbal walkthrough of the information.
